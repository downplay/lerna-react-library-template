# Data Dependencies

First let's describe exactly what a data dependency is. It means that a particular route is _dependent_ on some specific data being available, in order to fully render correctly.

Some analysis of this statement reveals a truth: data dependencies are inextricably bound to your routing. Libraries such as Apollo might try to abstract away or at least make this binding less painful, but the reality is that it is still there, just very cleverly hidden.

JARL attempts to tackle this requirement head-on, rather than letting it be an afterthought.

Let's take the previous example of a product page and see how this looks once we move the side-effects (actually loading the data) into our route map.

routes.js:

```js
import { RouteMapper } from "jarl-react";

const routes = new RouteMapper([
    {
        path: "/",
        state: { page: "home" }
    },
    {
        path: "/products/:productId",
        state: { page: "product" },
        match: async ({ productId }) => {
            const result = await fetch(`/api/products/${productId}`);
            const product = await result.json();
            return { product };
        }
    }
]);

export default routes;
```

By initiating data loads during routing, we can ensure that data is available _before_ switching routes and updating the page. JARL will wait for the Promise returned by our async function to resolve before updating the navigation state.

## Rejecting routes

Handling data in our routes table provides some additional benefits. One of these is that we can reject the route by rejecting the promise. Consider this example:

```js
import { RouteMapper } from "jarl-react";

const routes = new RouteMapper([
    {
        path: "/",
        state: { page: "home" }
    },
    {
        path: "/products/:productSlug",
        state: { page: "product" },
        match: async ({ productSlug }) => {
            const response = await fetch(
                `/api/productsBySlug?slug=${productSlug}`
            );
            if (!response.ok) {
                return Promise.reject("Not found");
            }
            const product = await response.json();
            return { product };
        }
    },
    {
        path: "/products/:productSlug",
        state: { page: "productSearch", notFound: true },
        match: async ({ productSlug }) => {
            const response = await fetch(
                `/api/productSearch?text=${productSlug.replace(" ", "")}`
            );
            const products = await response.json();
            return { products };
        }
    }
]);

export default routes;
```
